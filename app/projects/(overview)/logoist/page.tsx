            , we developed an AI-powered app that generates minimalistic logos
            based on three trendy styles. The process is simple: users enter a
            logo name, describe the brand, and select a style, creating a logo
            tailored to their brand identity.

        <h3>Purpose & Goal</h3>

        <p>
          This project was part of a weekly full-stack AI challenge, focusing on
          generating visually appealing, user-friendly image assets. The
          objective was to develop a logo generator that highlights our
          front-end, back-end, and AI integration skills using OpenAIâ€™s API.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working toward these goals shaped our approach and guided the choices
          we made for the tools and technologies to develop the project.
        </p>

      <section className="space-y-6">
        <h3>Web Stack & Explanation</h3>

        <div className="space-y-3">
          <p>
            Built with <b>Next.js</b> to leverage server-side rendering and SEO
            benefits, using the App Router to keep the structure organized,
            enhancing both performance and user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            To ensure type safety and minimize bugs, we used <b>TypeScript</b>{" "}
            to make the codebase easier to manage and scale, especially with
            complex components.
          </p>
          <p>
            We used <b>Tailwind CSS</b> to speed up styling with a utility-first
            approach, keeping the design minimal and the code clean.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>OpenAI's Dall-E 3</b> model powers the logo generator feature by
            generating custom designs based on the user's style of choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            We used <b>Clerk</b> as it simplifies authentication with pre-built
            components, allowing more focus on core functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            To reduce high image requests, <b>Upstash</b> was used to enable
            efficient rate limiting with a serverless, Redis-based solution,
            keeping access fast and scalable.

        <h3>Challenges & Thought Process</h3>
        <p>
          One of the primary challenges was managing API costs due to high image
          requests. To address this, we implemented a rate-limiting solution
          using Upstash to control the frequency of requests per user, ensuring
          sustainability while keeping the app open-source and accessible to
          everyone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another challenge was making sure the generated logos matched the
          styles we aimed for. Early prompts often produced logos that missed
          the mark. We had to experiment by testing different descriptions, and
          finding the right balance between detail and simplicity to guide the
          AI effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ran through multiple prompt variations to figure out what worked
          best. Adding clear details like specific shapes, color themes, and
          avoiding vague words made a big difference. This back & forth process
          helped us consistently get accurate and high-quality logos that
          matched the 3 style options, giving users a reliable and easy
          experience.

        <h3>Learnings</h3>

        <div className="space-y-3">
          <p>
            Experimenting with OpenAI introduced me to building interactive,
            AI-driven features. It learnt how to format prompts and clearly
            define the AI's role to get better and more accurate responses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Setting up Clerk for authentication saved time and provided insights
            into handling secure user sessions with minimal hassle. I also
            learned the importance of choosing third-party tools that simplify
            complex tasks without sacrificing security or user experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Collaborating with a team brought a fresh layer of teamwork and
            communication, working together to bring a shared vision to life.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, developing this app was a rewarding dive into modern web
            technologies, each bringing something unique to the stack and
            challenging me to grow as a developer.
